# JavaScript-API-Integration-DemoApp
A simple webapp which shows the usage of APIs in three different scenarios. Used Free APIs available in the market

Click on index.html to get started.

The APIs you see are of three different types though they are free to use:
1) Can be access directly without any API key
2) It has API Key built in the URL and exposed to everyone
3) Requires an API key to access the API.

App is only meant to check to functionality of APIs. Not user friendly.

Did not spend much time on Design. Would have created more attractive and interactive app but i did not have much time to spend on it.
